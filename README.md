# Sound Conductor - IoT Device Control Using A.I. Sound Classification

Welcome to Sound Conductor! This project is an application that allows users to control their IoT devices using custom sounds. By associating specific sounds with various actions. Users can effortlessly trigger actions such as opening blinds, turning on lights, and more, simply by clapping. 

Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Sound Conductor employs a TensorFlow-based machine learning model to classify different sounds, including single and double claps. The seamless synchronization between the front-end app and robust backend server ensures real-time communication and accurate execution of desired actions.
